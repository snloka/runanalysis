# runanalysis
Getting And Cleaning Data Project 3rd Week 

This project downloads the zipped data file into the current working directory, unzips it then loads and processes it to generate the output.

In order to run it just call run_analysis.R in your R command line prompt. Please make sure you have enough space for the data file to download and you have internet connection.
